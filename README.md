# shortcuts
Just some tiny scripts to make linux life a little more convenient. Coded for Kali (debian-based).

They will not work if you just download them and run them. They are very personalized and you will have to replace 1 or 2 variable names with literal strings (eg config file locations) in the program because if you had to add them as options, there would be no point.

Afterwards, Just make it executable and put it in your /bin folder.

One is literally just apt-get update && apt-get upgrade because why the hell do we type all that so often.

Basically, these are just persistent aliases that I have stored on a version of the cloud which looks good on a CV for someone who has 18 certificates but needs a degree to get a job and can't afford a degree without a job.

For the love of god will someone please hire me.
